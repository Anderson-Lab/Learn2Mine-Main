		<h3>FAQ</h3>
		<b>What is Learn2Mine?</b>
		<p>
		Learn2Mine is an Open Source, Cloud-Based platform hoping to instruct its users on the methods and practices of Data Mining and Management
		through Gameful experience. Learn2Mine integrates state of the art data mining tools with effective feedback and training mechanisms to lower
		the barrier for domain experts and computer scientists to learn data mining.
		</p>

		<b>How Does it Work?</b>
		<p>
		The Learn2Mine front end is powered by Google App Engine. From there, users are linked to our Galaxy server which provides them with the tools
		they need to effectively learn the desired skillset. Galaxy and App Engine interact seamlessly to give the user constant feedback to help shape
		their educational exposure to the world of Data Science.
		</p>

		<b>Has Learn2Mine Been Around Forever?</b>
		<p>
		Nope. Learn2Mine was designed by College of Charleston Undergraduate students Clayton Turner and Jake Dierksheide under the leadership
		of Dr. Paul Anderson, head of College of Charleston's Data Science Department. Any questions and comments can be directed to the contact information located
		on the "<a href="/Help">help</a>" page.
		</p>

		<b>What are these "Badges" I'm always hearing about?</b>
		<p>
		Our site implements Mozilla OpenBadges to allow users to track their educational growth and share their accomplishments with others. OpenBadges is a growing
		form of online credentials and the badges you earn from this site will go in your Mozilla Backpack, which you can use as a sort of online resume of your 
		programming accomplishments. For more information, visit their website at "<a href="http://openbadges.org/">openbadges.org</a>"
