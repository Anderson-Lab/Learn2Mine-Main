HOW TO START
============
Galaxy requires Python 2.6 or 2.7. To check your python version, run:

% python -V
Python 2.7.3

Start Galaxy:

% sh run.sh

Once Galaxy completes startup, you should be able to view Galaxy in your
browser at:

http://localhost:8080

You may wish to make changes from the default configuration.  This can be done
in the universe_wsgi.ini file.  Tools are configured in tool_conf.xml.  Details
on adding tools can be found on the Galaxy website (linked above).

Not all dependencies are included for the tools provided in the sample
tool_conf.xml.  A full list of external dependencies is available at:
